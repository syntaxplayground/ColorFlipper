# Exploring the Core of Web Development

Welcome to the repository for "Exploring the Core of Web Development: Understanding the Anatomy of a Web Page" â€“ a comprehensive guide aimed at demystifying the fundamental components that make up a web page. This project is an interactive demonstration of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together to create dynamic and responsive web experiences.
